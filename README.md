### `Creation of the project`

This project was created in VsCode using `npx create-react-app WebPortfolio`

The WebSites purpose is to practice coding in React, but also creating a platform 
that displays my other projects as well as a little info about myself.

### `Imports used`

The imports i used for this priject was:
**npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons**
**npm install react-router-dom react-vertical-timeline-component**

### `Home`

The Homepage displays a short list of the technoligies i have been working with.
The whole WebSite features a NavBar that can be seen at the top,
as well as a interactive footer at the bottom of the page.

The skills featured at the bottom might be outdated, because I'm spending my time 
developing new projects.

All the projects here are clickable and will open a new page showing a preview of the project. 
The preview contains screenshots, information and a clickable GitHub-icon 
that redirects to the corresponding project-repository.


### `Experience`

The Experience-page features a timeline showing my work and education experiences.
It goes back to High-School and all the way to where I'm working today.
